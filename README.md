# T1-To-T2-Upper-Airway-MRI

To run the codes used in this project, the following steps should be followed:
1. Download codes from the repository: https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix 
2. Run the UpperAirwayCycleGAN.iypnb


## Dependencies
Same as the codes in https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix 

## Dataset
The datasets used a can be found from USC open source dataset A multispeaker dataset of raw and reconstructed speech production real-time MRI video and 3D volumetric images (https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/A_multispeaker_dataset_of_raw_and_reconstructed_speech_production_real-time_MRI_video_and_3D_volumetric_images/13725546/1)
